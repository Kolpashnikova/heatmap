# PieChart on Map and Heatmap 

In these files you will find R codes and short datasets for producing map+piechart and heatmap visualizations.

**.dta files** contain the datasets (if heatmap1 does not load into R - save it as an earlier version of Stata 12 or earlier or use heatmap2.dta).

**R files** contain R codes for producing graphs.

**Rplot.jpeg** is how the heatmap will look like using the data and the code.
This graphs shows the states where there is better parity in gender wage gap (white and blue) and the states where women still face discrimination in being paid less than men for the same amount of work.

**Sports.jpeg** is how the map+pie chart will look like using the data and the code.
The graph contains three subplots all in California, Oregon, and Washington
- In the first one, the pie charts indicate localities where women proportionally report doing more sports than men.
- In the second one, localities where men report doing more sports than women proportionally.
- In the third one, it shows the proportions of women and men in localities by their time spent on jogging on an average day. 
Overall, we can see that women do more sports than men in Oregon (especially, jog), whereas South Californian men do more sports compared to women in the same region. 

Moreover, if one is a woman who seeks an equality in pay and might not like the stereotypes that women are less athletic than men - one might want to consider to move to Oregon and take up jogging :) [though I might still like Vancouver more^^]
